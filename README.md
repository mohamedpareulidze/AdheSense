# AdheSense – Intelligent Rail Grip System  
**Agorize × Ferrocampus Innovation Challenge (Rail Safety & Performance)**

---

## 🚆 Project Overview

**AdheSense** is an intelligent rail grip and adhesion-monitoring system designed to help railway operators **anticipate, detect, and mitigate adhesion loss**—a major cause of braking failures, wheel slip, and service disruptions.  
The goal: increase **rail safety**, improve **predictive maintenance**, and reduce **operational costs** using **real-time sensing** and **AI-driven decision support**. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## 🎯 The Challenge

Railway operators face recurrent issues caused by poor rail adhesion:  
- Longer braking distances  
- Reduced traction  
- Wheel flats and accelerated wear  
- Delays and service disruption  
- Safety risks in wet or leaf-fall seasons  

Traditional solutions are reactive; AdheSense introduces a **proactive, intelligent approach**.

## 💡 Solution: The AdheSense System

AdheSense combines three pillars: :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  

### **1. Real-Time Adhesion Monitoring**  
Multimodal sensors capture:  
- Wheel-rail friction coefficients  
- Temperature, humidity, and contaminants  
- Wheel slip events and micro-vibrations  

### **2. Predictive Grip Analysis**  
Machine learning models forecast adhesion levels and detect risk conditions before they occur.

### **3. Intelligent Mitigation System**  
Based on sensor insights, the system can:  
- Suggest optimized braking curves  
- Trigger preventive wheel slip control  
- Recommend sanding or track cleaning  
- Send alerts to operators and maintenance teams

## 🧠 Why This Matters

AdheSense enables railway operators to shift from **reaction** to **prediction**, delivering tangible benefits:

- **↑ Safety**: Reduced braking incidents  
- **↑ Reliability**: Fewer disruptions from adhesion loss  
- **↓ Maintenance costs**: Less wheel damage, optimized sanding  
- **↑ Energy efficiency**: Better traction management  

The system is designed for **scalability** and **integration** with existing rolling stock.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

According to the final presentation: :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  

- On-board sensing module (vibration, slip, weather conditions)  
- Edge computing unit for real-time signal processing  
- Cloud platform for long-term analysis and model training  
- Operator dashboard with alerts & predictive insights  
- Optional API integration with train control systems (ATO/ATP)

## 📊 Impact & Evaluation

AdheSense was evaluated against several impact metrics:

- **Safety Impact:** Reduction in low-adhesion incidents  
- **Operational Efficiency:** Fewer delays due to traction problems  
- **Maintenance Optimization:** Lower wheel/rail degradation  
- **Environmental Benefits:** Controlled and reduced sanding usage
